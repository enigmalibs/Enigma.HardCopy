/// ViewModel of the application shell: the window title, and the navigation rail the two pages hang off.

/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// <see cref="INavigationService"/> is exposed for binding rather than wrapped, and it is the one library
/// service a ViewModel in this application names: its <c>CurrentPage</c> is an Avalonia
/// <see cref="Control"/> by definition, so a wrapper would only move the type one file over.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// A <see cref="NavigationItem"/> is the single declaration site for a page — its rail header, its icon, its
/// view type and its ViewModel type — which is why nothing here needs a page base class or a name-matching
/// view locator. <see cref="CreatePage"/> resolves both halves from the container, so a page and its
/// ViewModel may take constructor dependencies; views are registered transient and page ViewModels singleton,
/// so revisiting a page gets a fresh control and the state it was left in.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>The constructor navigates nowhere.</b> It builds the rail and stops: the first item is selected by
/// <see cref="App"/> once the container is up, which keeps this ViewModel constructible — and the rail
/// assertable — with no windowing platform behind it.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The two rail icons are handed in rather than resolved here. Turning a Phosphor glyph into a
/// <see cref="Geometry"/> builds a <c>StreamGeometry</c>, which needs Avalonia's platform render interface:
/// present in the running app, absent in a test process. The container's factory passes
/// <see cref="AppIcons"/>, and a test passes its own.
