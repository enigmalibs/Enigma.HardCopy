/// The library ships no registration extension of its own, so this is it. All six are singletons: three of

/// This lives in its own file, apart from the application's own registrations, because
/// <c>Enigma.Avalonia.Desktop.Services</c> and <c>Enigma.HardCopy.Desktop.Services</c> both declare an
/// <c>IFileDialogService</c>: a single file importing both namespaces would not compile (<c>CS0104</c>). Here
